# json-to-html-with-c
parsing json archive with c

--->I strongly recommend using  the Dev-C++ compiler (which i used to create the project) in order to minimize the possibility of appearance errors associated with the compiler
Be aware of that I have noticed that when i tried to run it with GNU Compiler did not run the command -> system"pause"

here is a link for downloading the Dev-C++ compiler      https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/

--->The program creates txt file with the tranformed array so typicaly in the txt file is printed the transformed array and there the character ' Â· '  is displayed correctly because in c it 
couldn 't presented because there isn t in the ASCII table that c uses

--->Thus after you run the program a txt file will apeared in the file with the transformed array

--->The file with that contains the project has inside the json archive it is important to be at the same file the project and the json in order to run correctly. Thus run the program from the file that was when  you  donwloaded
